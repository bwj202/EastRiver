# EastRiver
This repository contains files required to import the East River catchment into the GREAT-ER model.

Catchment files for use within the GREAT-ER model are contained in the CatchmentFiles folder for 2010, 2015 and 2020.

The GREAT-ER model v3 with the sediment extension will be required to use these catchment files. 
More recent versions of the GREAT-ER model may not be compatible.
